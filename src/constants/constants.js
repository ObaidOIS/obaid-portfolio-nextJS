    description:"BWMM is an ecommerce store web-based application built using ReactJS and Node.js. The architecture of BWMM follows the D2C model, where retailers can sell their products directly to customers. The primary aim of this project was to provide customers with a secure payment procedure through crypto wallets, specifically Coinbase Commerce, and encrypted bank payments via Stripe. To achieve this, we integrated the Coinbase Commerce API and the Stripe payment gateway into the application. Customers can make purchases using their MetaMask wallet or through encrypted bank payments. The application also features a responsive design and a user-friendly interface that allows customers to easily browse through products, add them to their cart, and complete their purchases.",
